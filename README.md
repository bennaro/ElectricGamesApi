# ElectricGamesApi

This README provides an overview of the Electric Games backend, a RESTful API for managing video game information.

# Project Setup

Prerequisites:
* .NET SDK 8.0 or later installed on your system. You can download it from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://your-github-repo-url.git
Use code with caution.
```
Restore Dependencies:
```
cd ElectricGamesBackend
dotnet restore
```

# Running the API

Build the Project:
```
dotnet build
```
Run the Application:
```
dotnet run
```

This will typically start the API on the default port (usually 5000). You can verify its status by accessing http://localhost:5000/ in your browser (the exact port might vary).

# API Endpoints

You can now make requests to the API endpoints to perform various operations related to games, gamecharacters and consoles. You can add, update and delete the data.
